## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
# Then clone your fork locally

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/misinformation-defense.git
cd misinformation-defense

# Add the original repository as upstream
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-org/misinformation-defense.git
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

Follow our [Setup Guide](SETUP_GUIDE.md) to set up your local development environment.

```bash
# Quick setup
make setup-new-dev

# Start development environment
make dev
```

### 3. Create a Branch

```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch for your feature
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

## üìù Development Guidelines

### Code Style

#### Backend (Python)

We use the following tools for code quality:

```bash
# Format code
black .
isort .

# Lint code
flake8 .
mypy .

# Or use make commands
make format-backend
make lint-backend
```

**Style Guidelines:**
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Keep functions small and focused (< 50 lines preferred)
- Use meaningful variable and function names

#### Frontend (TypeScript/React)

```bash
# Format and lint
npm run lint
npm run format

# Type checking
npm run type-check

# Or use make commands
make format-frontend
make lint-frontend
```

**Style Guidelines:**
- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Follow React best practices and hooks patterns
- Use proper component naming (PascalCase)
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Write accessible components (ARIA labels, semantic HTML)

### Testing

#### Backend Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=app --cov-report=html

# Test specific files
pytest tests/test_api.py -v
```

**Testing Guidelines:**
- Write unit tests for all business logic
- Include integration tests for API endpoints
- Mock external services (Vertex AI, Firestore, etc.)
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Use descriptive test names

#### Frontend Tests

```bash
# Unit tests
npm run test

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Component tests
npm run test:components
```

**Testing Guidelines:**
- Test user interactions and workflows
- Test component rendering and state changes
- Mock API calls and external dependencies
- Test accessibility features
- Include visual regression tests for UI components

### Documentation

- Update README.md for significant changes
- Add/update API documentation in OpenAPI format
- Include inline code comments for complex logic
- Update setup guides for new dependencies
- Write clear commit messages
